    "1. Indexing: We will perform embeddings to create two vectorstores from two kinds of data sources. First is a couple of pairs of customer query and corresponding response to that query. This provides few shot examples in the prompt for the AI system to generate the reply to the customer. The second is product information from a knowledge base which in this case is stored in a csv file. A self-querying retriever is used as product information is stored in the Document metadata. The product information retrieved will be used as context in the LLM prompt.\n",
    "2. Construct the chains with LangChain Expression Language: As there are several tasks broken down into steps, there is a need to make a few LLM calls in a certain sequence. The steps are implemented in subchains and then put together in a final overall chain.\n",
    "3. Evaluation: Test the final chain with various test cases."

Oh, and took over Twitter.\\n\\nWhen Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.\\n\\nHis father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.\\n\\nIt was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.\\n\\nFor two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?', metadata={'author': 'Walter Isaacson', 'genre': 'biography', 'price': 36.75, 'rating': 4.7, 'title': 'Elon Musk', 'year': 2023}),\n",
